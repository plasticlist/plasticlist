# PlasticList

## Background

Nat Friedman [announced testing](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1789287484515659896) food, drinks, and household items in California for plastic chemicals.

In turn, we built PlasticList: an open-source UI for Nat's tests. To start, we are launching a database of all popular food, drink, and household products in CA, so you can upvote items to test first.

You can see the UI here: [PlasticList](https://www.plasticlist.app/)

## Why This Matters

Emerging research shows that plastic chemicals are inside all of us and can affect sperm quality, fertility, and cancer risk. The scale is vast and growing. 

Nat's tests will help us understand our exposure levels, guide new policy decisions, and drive scientific discoveries. PlasticList is a UI to enable this important work.

## Features

- **Today**: Add or upvote products you want tested for plastic chemicals.
- **Next Week**: Access interactive research summaries.
- **Soon**: Analyze Nat's findings, find links to research grants, get templates to petition your representative, and more.

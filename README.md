# PlasticList

## Background

Nat Friedman [announced testing](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1789287484515659896) food, drinks, and household items in California for plastic chemicals.

PlasticList is an open-source UI for Nat's tests. To start, we are testing popular food and drink in the Bay Area and sharing what we learn along the way.

You can use the UI here: [PlasticList](https://www.plasticlist.app/)

## Why This Matters

Emerging research shows that plastic chemicals are inside all of us and can affect sperm quality, fertility, and cancer risk. The scale is vast and growing. 

Nat's tests will help us understand our exposure levels, guide new policy decisions, and drive scientific discoveries. PlasticList is a UI to enable this important work.
